topic: Waterfall
desc: "A model of the Software Design Life Cycle (SDLC) from the 1970s"

Waterfall is often credited to a paper by William Royce called "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems",
which can be found [here](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci201/lectures/Lecture11/royce1970.pdf) and [here](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=41801)

Sources do not agree on whether this paper is from 

* 1970 Proceedings of IEEE WESCON 26 (August): 1â€“9.
* 1987. Proceedings of the 9th international conference on Software Engineering (ICSE '87). 

(In any case, for undergrad students in the second or third decade of the 21st century, it hardly matters.)

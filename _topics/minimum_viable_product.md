The idea of a **Minimum Viable Product** is to build an implementation of your product idea that is
* **minimal**: as simple as possible, as quick to build as possible
* **viable**: a customer using this product would say: "yes this meets a need I have".

The main idea is to **start getting user feedback as quickly as possible**.

The essence of Agile is "inspect and adapt".  
* You never know if you are building the **right thing**, unless and until you see **real users
using it**.
* You need to get to that stage **as quickly as possible**.

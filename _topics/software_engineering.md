The term has also been used less formally:

* as the informal contemporary term for the broad range of activities that were formerly called computer programming and systems analysis;[8]
* as the broad term for all aspects of the practice of computer programming, as opposed to the theory of computer programming, which is formally studied as a sub-discipline of computer science;[9]
* as the term embodying the advocacy of a specific approach to computer programming, one that urges that it be treated as an engineering discipline rather than an art or a craft, and advocates the codification of recommended practices.[10]

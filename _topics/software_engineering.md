According to Wikipedia (retreived 02/28/2019), the term **Software Engineering** has been defined in many ways, including these:

"Notable definitions of software engineering include:"


* "the systematic application of scientific and technological knowledge, methods, and experience to the design, implementation, testing, and documentation of software" (ANSI/IEEE Std. 729-1983)
* "The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software" (IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology)
* "an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production" (Ian Sommerville)

"The term has also been used less formally"

* "as the informal contemporary term for the broad range of activities that were formerly called computer programming and systems analysis" 
* "as the broad term for all aspects of the practice of computer programming, as opposed to the theory of computer programming, which is formally studied as a sub-discipline of computer science" Education: SEI Conference 1990, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, April 2â€“3,... Springer. ISBN 978-0-387-97274-9.,p. 26 |
* as the term embodying the advocacy of a specific approach to computer programming, one that urges that it be treated as an engineering discipline rather than an art or a craft, and advocates the codification of recommended practices

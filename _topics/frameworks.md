According to [Wikipedia (retrieved 2018-12-27)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework), a Software Framework (itemization added):

* is "an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software". 
* "provides a standard way to build and deploy applications. 
* "is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications, products and solutions. 
* "may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or system."

Three distinguishing features (still from [Wikipedia (retrieved 2018-12-27)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework))

* *inversion of control*: In a framework, unlike in libraries or in standard user applications, the overall program's flow of control is not dictated by the caller, but by the framework.

* *extensibility*: A user can extend the framework – usually by selective overriding – or programmers can add specialized user code to provide specific functionality.

* *non-modifiable framework code*: The framework code, in general, is not supposed to be modified, while accepting user-implemented extensions. In other words, users can extend the framework, but should not modify its code.

# Examples

C++:
* Unreal Engine (game engine)
* QT: (Gui development)

Java:
* Spring, and Spring Boot (web app development)

Python:
* Flask (web app development)
* Django (web app development)
* Pygame (game development)

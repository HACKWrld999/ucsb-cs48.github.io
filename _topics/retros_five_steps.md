A successful formula for retrospectives that has been used by many practitioners is 
the following five stage formula, which comes from the book 
[Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great](http://www.estherderby.com/books) by [Esther Derby](http://www.estherderby.com/) and 
[Dianna Larson](https://www.futureworksconsulting.com/about/diana-larsen).

* Step 1: Set the Stage
* Step 2: Gather Data
* Step 3: Generating Insights
* Step 4: Decide What To Do
* Step 5: Close the Retro

There are a variety of exercises that can be used for each of these steps.  The facilitator of the retro has the responsibility for
choosing practices that they think will be effective for their team, taking into account factors
such as:
* the personalities of the team members
* the level of familiarity they have with the retro process
* the setting in which the retro is taking place
* the particular challenges facing the team

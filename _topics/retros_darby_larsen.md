A successful formula for retrospectives that has been used by many practitioners is 
the following five stage formula, which comes from the book 
[Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great](http://www.estherderby.com/books) by [Esther Derby](http://www.estherderby.com/) and 
[Dianna Larsen](https://www.futureworksconsulting.com/about/diana-larsen).

* Step 1: Set the Stage
* Step 2: Gather Data
* Step 3: Generating Insights
* Step 4: Decide What To Do
* Step 5: Close the Retro

# Exercises

There are a variety of exercises that can be used for each of these steps.  

* The website [Retro-mat](https://retromat.org/en/) contains over 100 activities in English (and six 
   other languages including 中文) that new retro leaders can choose from.  Other guides to leading retros are 
   listed below.

* Spotify (yes, that Spotify) has a [Spotify Retro Kit](https://labs.spotify.com/2017/12/15/spotify-retro-kit/) that they've put
   together to help their teams run successful retros.
   
# Choosing Exercises   

The facilitator of the retro has the responsibility for
choosing practices that they think will be effective for their team, taking into account factors
such as:
* the personalities of the team members
* the level of familiarity they have with the retro process
* the setting in which the retro is taking place
* the particular challenges facing the team

# Big Picture Values

It's helpful to choose practices that are fun and engaging, and to change up the practices so that 
folks don't get bored with the exercise.  However, even more important is to focus on these big picture 
values:

* Try to structure activities so that *everyone's* voices are heard
   * Help folks that are more vocal to keep their sharing short and make space
   * Help folks that are less vocal to feel comfortable speaking up
* It is helpful for the facilitator to focus on *facilitating* not *participating*
   * The facilitator may have their own opinions
   * While conducting the retro, they may like to set those aside
   * Instead, consider focusing ONLY on helping the other participants voices be heard.

# Guides for retrospective faciltators

I would not suggest that you read ALL of these articles before running your first retro---that could lead to information
overload.  

Instead, I suggest skimming through until you find ONE that resonates for you and gives you a sense that you
can take this on successfully.  Then go back and revisit the other articles later as you get more experience.

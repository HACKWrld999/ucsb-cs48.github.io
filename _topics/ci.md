Continuous Integration (CI) is an industry standard practice for professional software development.

Some commonly used CI systems include:
* Jenkins
* Travis-CI
* GitHub Actions

# GitHub Actions

GitHub actions are controlled via a hidden directory called `.github/workflows` in the root of a GitHub repository.

Documentation:
* <https://help.github.com/en/actions>

Examples:

# Travis-CI

You can use Travis-CI for free on pretty much any open source github.com repo that has a `.travis.yml` file in it.

You log into <http://travis-ci.org> with your github.com username/password in order to set it up.

Martin Fowler and Kent Beck (the designer of JUnit) are the authors of a very influential book called  “Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code”.

In Fowler’s book, he introduces twenty-two specific “code smells”, along with specific guidance for fixing the smelly code and replacing it with better code; this process is called "refactoring".

In general, in the context of software development, *refactoring* refers to the process of making changes to code that:
* do not change the functionality of the code, but
* make it easier to understand and maintain: i.e. make it easier to fix bugs and add new features.

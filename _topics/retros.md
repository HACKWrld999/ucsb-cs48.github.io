It is good practice---some would say, essential to doing Agile properly---to hold 
a "retrospective meeting" (or "retro" for short) at the end of each iteration (aka "sprint").


The purpose of a retro can be summed up as:
* identify what's going well and what's not going well
* figure out how to turn up the good, and turn down the bad

On the [Agile101 Guide](https://agilealliance.org/agile101) 
the "every sprint" retro is called the [heartbeat retros](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/heartbeatretro).
We'l consider these terms to mean the same thing:
* Sprint Retro
* Iteration Retro
* Heartbeat Retro

# Milestone Retro vs. Sprint Retro

The [Agile 101 Guide](https://agilealliance.org/agile101) also meantions a longer-form [milestone retro](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/milestone-retrospective/)
which is held less often---maybe once or twice a year, for example---which the team reaches a major milestone in their
product development.    Because of the short length of the 10-week quarter at UCSB, in the context of CS48, we might do a 
*milestone retro*, if at all,  at the end of the entire course, to reflect on the course as a whole.

# Retro Templates and Retro Activities

A "retro template" is a high-level outline for structuring a retro.  Here are some popular templates:

* {% include link.md text='Start/Stop/Continue' href='/topics/retros_start_stop_continue/' %}: the team reflects on
     * what activites want to stop doing (because they aren't helpful)
     * what activities they want to start doing (because they think it will help)
     * what activities they should continue (because they are working well)

* {% include link.md text='Darby/Larsen 5-Step Retro' href='/topics/retros_darby_larsen/' %}: This retro template,
   introducted by 
   [Esther Derby](http://www.estherderby.com/) and 
   [Dianna Larsen](https://www.futureworksconsulting.com/about/diana-larsen)
   in the book [Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great](http://www.estherderby.com/books)
   has five steps:
   * Step 1: Set the Stage
   * Step 2: Gather Data
   * Step 3: Generating Insights
   * Step 4: Decide What To Do
   * Step 5: Close the Retro

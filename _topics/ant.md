# The short version:

* Ant is similar in purpose to Make/Makefiles for C/C++

# Differences between Ant and make

* XML syntax instead of ideosyncratic Makefile syntax (tabs? what?)
* Built in Java, so its ostensibly portable like Java (Makefiles are very Unix centric)
* You control your project with a file called `build.xml` instead of `Makefile`
* You type `ant` instead of `make`, or, for example: 
    * `ant compile` instead of `make executablename`
    * `ant clean` instead of `make clean`

# There is more information about Ant at the [CS56 page for Ant](https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/topics/ant/)

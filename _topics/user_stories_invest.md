INVEST is an acronym for writing good stories.

Note that it isn't possible to do all of these perfectly, all of the time.   These are goals and guidelines, not dogma.

| Criterion | Explanation |
|-----------|--------------|
| Indepdenent | Ideally, it doesn't depend on other stories getting done first. |
| Negotiable | High level, not overly detailed.  Leave some room for the team to make choices. |
| Valuable  | It needs to help the end user meet a need or fulfill a desire. |
| Estimatable | Not so vague that we have no idea how long it will take. |
| Small     | Smaller stories are easier to estimate, manage and deliver. |
| Testable | We need to be able to demonstrate we are done, and we did it right. |

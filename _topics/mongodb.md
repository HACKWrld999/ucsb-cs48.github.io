MongoDB is a particular implementation of a technology known as NoSQL databases.

The basic idea is that you can store JSON objects in the cloud.   
Everything else is just sort of a riff on that theme.

# Setting up a MongoDB database

The current recommended provider for MongoDB databases is Mongo Cloud Atlas.

An article on gettings started is here:

# JavaScript/Node Specific

* [Node MongoDB Native 3.6 API docs](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/api/)

# Java/Spring Boot Specific

* [MongoDB Javadoc](http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.6/javadoc/)

* <http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.7/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/MongoCollection.html>

# Older MLab documentation

MLab is an older MongoDB platform; it is currently deprecated and not allowing new accounts, since the company was bought out by the folks that provide MongoDB Cloud Atlas.

The documentation below is provided only for understanding older example applications.


Here is a repo that demos MLab in the context of a Spring Boot application:
* <https://github.com/pconrad-webapps/simple-java-mlab-demo>

There is already a lot of info about MongoDB at this other website: <http://pconrad-webapps.github.io/topics/mongodb/>
* In particular, this page about Java stuff: <http://pconrad-webapps.github.io/topics/mongodb_java/>
* It also discusses how to get started with [MLab](http://pconrad-webapps.github.io/topics/mongodb_mlab/) which is a particular provider of MongoDB (e.g. Mlab is to MongoDB like github is to git)

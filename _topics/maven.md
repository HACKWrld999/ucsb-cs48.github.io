topic: Maven
desc: A build tool for Java plus a package manager
---

The short version:

* Maven adds package management to the functions that you get with Ant.
* By package management, I mean that instead of you having to manage the process of obtaining all the .jar files for third party library that
  your project may depend on (and the .jars that *those* files depend on, and so on...), maven manages that for you.
* If you are doing serious software development (e.g. a CS48 project) in Java, you should probably
   be using Maven or Gradle (not Ant, and certainly not "just winging it with shell scripts", or relying
   on a specific IDE.)

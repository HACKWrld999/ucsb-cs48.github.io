[Heroku](https://heroku.com) is a "platform as a service" (PAAS) cloud-computing platform.

At least as of this writing (August 2018), Heroku has a free tier that
we can use without needing a credit card to try out web applications)
in the cloud.  This allows us to run Java/Python/Rails/Node.js web
applications and make them available 24x7 on the public internet.


# The Heroku Toolbelt (aka Heroku CLI)

The "Heroku Toolbelt" is a command-line interface to Heroku that you can install on Windows, Mac or Linux.

As of this writing (08/27/2018), the Heroku toolbelt is also available on the CSIL machines and the machines in Phelps 3525 (CSTL).

* Use `heroku login` to login to your heroku account for your current CSIL shell session
* Use the command `heroku` to list the available commands
* Use `heroku logout` if you want to logout and login to a different heroku account.


# Using Heroku with various platforms

* There is documentation on using Heroku with Java apps on the CS56 websites.
* There is documentation on using Heroku with Python Flask apps on the CS8 website.

If you need access to this, post an instructor note on Piazza, and we'll track down the links and link them from here.

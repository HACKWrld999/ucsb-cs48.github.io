In developing user stories for a product, it can be helpful to visualize one or more typical users.
Sometimes we come up with a fictional character, and flesh them out with a name, backstory, etc.
to make the user story process more vivid and interesting.  These characters are called personas.

The software designer [Alan Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Cooper) phrases it this way:
"Make up pretend users and design for them".

This is typically more than one persona for a given product, since your product may be used by 
more than one category of person.  For example, in a RideShare app, there are at least two
different personas:
* The person offering a ride
* The person looking for a ride
A third person might be the administrator of the ride sharing system that does tasks such as 
moderating comments, blocking users that abuse the system, etc.

User Stories should:

* Be entered as cards on your groups Kanban board
* Should be written in the "As an x I can y so that z" form, unless there is a good reason to deviate from that format.

Just like user stories, issues should be examined against the [INVEST criteria](/topics/user_stories_invest/).
Generally speaking, as compared to user stories, issues:

* may be slightly less "**I**ndepenent" and "**N**egotiable"
* should be equally "**V**aluable"
* even more "**E**stimatable", "**S**mall" and "**T**estable"

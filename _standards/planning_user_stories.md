Having a set of standards around process helps us use these tools more effectively.

Keep in mind, however, that in Agile, we are invited to value "individuals and interactions over processes and tools".

The processes and tools serve us, not the other way around.

* It is ok to modify the standard if there is a good reason to do so, i.e. if the team sees that a different way of working will get better results.
* These modifications should be done following the "inspect and adapt" principle

What is less ok is to simply fail to follow the standard because:
* You haven't taken the time to understand the standards
* You are cutting corners out of laziness
* You aren't paying enough attention
* You are in a rush because you procrastinated

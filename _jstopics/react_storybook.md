Storybook (documented at: <https://storybook.js.org/> is a tool for cataloging, documenting, and testing JavaScript UI components.  

It can be used with many frameworks, but for this page, we focus on its use with React.

Here are three examples of React Storybooks, along with the repos from which the UI components are taken
